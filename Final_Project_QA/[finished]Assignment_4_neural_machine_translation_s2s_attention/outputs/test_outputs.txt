You know what I do is to write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, most of you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is generally something that fell somewhere that fell somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, at the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I was just shooting up to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He was doing it secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never ever met us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to get you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we went to <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and it took us from her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and <unk>
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today to talk about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them down to me around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't more to think about a <unk> on the other <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when you get out of the glaciers or they break down the ice shelves,
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give and hold up to the end, whereas others cannot be <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing his atmosphere <unk>
As a battery melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually get to see a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, he starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg from Greenland, average size.
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stay too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding itself, I'm not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm are joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talking about them later.
In my activity that I have two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people will <unk> the anatomy -- that is, in human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average ones.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex whose physics does not fit into the male <unk> and feminine <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> has lots of shapes.
I'm going to put a few examples in ways of having sex that doesn't fall into the common form or females.
For example, there is the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that becomes <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testes make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, your body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels and no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops by a female course.
When you get older, the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast and developing the breast of it, but you don't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing examinations you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have the body something called the <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know his structure -- I believe being a typical woman most women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that are <unk>
So sex is complicated -- it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as a <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a known disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes -- and in the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component of typically male men.
He was born with <unk> nobody would <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- you know, whether they are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to have any better physical health of it.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to several surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> being black to say to have the anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born like two people in the same body.
The most high peak is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in the art of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you journalists that have no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of the science, we have to admit that these <unk> categories were going to admit that these <unk> categories were <unk> directly to <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
And as we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you mean from the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
And our ancestors never had to take them with this question of whether someone was dead.
Like a lot to put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved you still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it down.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to address the dilemma of really determining death, and this puts us in a difficult situation that we don't have the simple categories.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be <unk> someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he puts you nervous.
So what we thought is that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about as much as we were thinking so.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every bit of watching that music, <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> of the old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was going on by the right of blood passed away from the grandfather and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system in which they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it gets very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power being passed passed through a kind of <unk> right idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And consequently, we were passing the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of human rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us and was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, <unk> people that are going to be <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at suburbia we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you a fish for the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years they were supposed to allow them to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1 1980s.
Henry, on the contrary, was born last one of March <unk>
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights for three months before Henry -- the right to Henry sex -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the <unk> astrophysics from Mary <unk>
Mary, for his part, does not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So they are still <unk> categories that are in various aspects to be <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advanced both in the anatomy of anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at some point has decided to get married with a man -- you don't have to have chromosome, and you have to get married with a woman you have to have the y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests by the people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you to the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would say <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge <unk> people not in their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this for people's rights to people, because I've just admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relations that I know.
So how do you put the topic of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America is going to continue this current current of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a <unk> identical <unk> to then pick up and then pick up their <unk>
But when the phone asked the operation, I asked the purpose of the operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum <unk> rather than <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to conclude, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we have given more involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and I think that there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about group.
For years, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in school, one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> as a <unk> he made me an <unk>
<unk> what's the feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I thought about her in his question, more than there is something feminine in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something -- on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you were <unk> they were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that we have made more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just led to the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were either <unk> and that the other half will not have to do it.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and the causes of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, build a whole new building building -- always and when the rules of that place would be able to build the construction instead of putting it down.
So I proposed that governments would provide new zones of serious reform to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
Later I learned more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could do and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next few elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform on which promise and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of trials with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most valued ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say they can't go and annoy all the current residents on apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Indian friend sent to <unk> a bond with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in Miami, a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City -- in some cases, worth thousands of dollars square.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is going to take the rules out there and a choice so that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I came up with another data full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
The entire world is <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and show the TEDTalk.
And this explained a <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city to which you could go could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And they also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries associated with them to make the rules of <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And so little later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just moved through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional was <unk>
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
February 17th, passed over again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting to 24 in February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is being built in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after it was four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers <unk> and sometimes it would be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for instance of this new justice system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to move into the <unk> especially in a place with free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, work, sometimes they're <unk> mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or would you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to be thinking about so that families can choose between several cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession in public -- and it's that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, wearing and more recently, photographing and publish and publish in my blog and colorful <unk> and different <unk>
But I didn't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is two hand of <unk> markets, and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My money is going to look like, and buy it into my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'll like color.
That's less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings you to have someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes and nothing else.
<unk> for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
I call this bright tiger tiger ...
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> took me, and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people right now, not just <unk> you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you take in.
Sometimes people tell me that I play the <unk> or I remind them for their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> Trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week just by what I was wearing. And we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I am going to give the whole thing.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave the back of certain things.
I don't need to pay <unk> to these things, because right around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> colorful suit, if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic -- and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is totally logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists <unk> we need quite a lot of logic for <unk> these ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed over the time of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking seat.
It was a small kid and didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet you play that bar out of that parking lot, I showed it a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years ago -- you need of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it also doesn't be good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't find it.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see he's been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal metal, with a springboard and which shows up supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole with a kind of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an quantum <unk> but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then the other kind of people go up with doing those things, because I don't want to eat them, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects of inanimate objects are not just the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We took the lights on, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled it down to a temperature of less than one degree per degree above absolute zero.
Now, when it's only in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way he <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And to give it a soft soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't want at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all of the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was the shame line in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is sort of the same than the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my kind of <unk>
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all of the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that was here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories and stories are <unk> with 17 very interesting museums about nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just this slide and this slide is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- I was not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go into the museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show you the demo, so you can tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums out there.
There's the gallery at MoMA, <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't matter.
You move around and they <unk>
Would you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
You're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
continue to go forward. What are they <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around very simple.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really would want to do it?
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks like <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a stick on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And we're going to get you even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best one is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really would be <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well as before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online and create your own museum, to create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple -- we put -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just <unk> around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel about contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that makes me today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm out of Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in India. One in the last two decades.
Now sometime ago, if you wanted to win a race race race and take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you put the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, you have a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer computers.
And as a <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a story -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but it represents 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms to become <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old <unk> dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end I took the hammer and he threw it to the <unk> -- he actually can see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "I <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and make something.
Let's start with the detection of the target.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of <unk>
It was the year in which Italy, I won the World Cup up.
Maybe some of the remember, they were in Italy, and they were France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day is looking at activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the late sooner there are people over here and doing call phone call.
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
People do a fast call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of <unk>
First time I took a second time.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk>
You see the big <unk>
The next day everyone was at the center of the winner of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> <unk> people will <unk> it is a great party, you can see the spike at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume them.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project we developed a little bit of little tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
<unk>
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't just disappear that it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> one day still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you cut <unk> valves <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels end the pixels can be written in them, showing patterns, images texts.
And by zoom in the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had an commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all of the architecture disappears as in this case.
There will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, then the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's <unk> almost all of the architecture away.
This is how it works.
You see the <unk> people so it goes on inside.
And here I am myself trying to fail to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun than that.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and water and one had to jump up to get wet.
<unk> noise) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with that people are used.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, right?
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration, in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different kind of thing.
So imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of 3D pixels that you can reach, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people, from the movement of people, and so on, etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best newspaper dancers on the New York star -- the star of New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's both 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment, as a <unk> farm as the <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could get everybody to take a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've seen everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world, of the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this can be used to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made by pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move around, you can have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it can be to share the main moments of the 2012 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they're <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve it by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might want to be more likely to be stronger to have a resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safer of themselves?
What about good health?
Or maybe those people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What's the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> you probably owe the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED conference, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: It's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one end, is, of course, that we're interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here for a few thousand years old.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on our gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about it, think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you want without effort to be <unk>
It's really like a rapid pathway for bacteria to the occasional silence, of some rush to the output.
But anyway, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and they protect from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or we were destined to become something different, maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique <unk> and the human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- each cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death of <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her hotel door at night.
He opens the door.
And in front of him is a gorgeous <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> you look for a <unk> of <unk>
"I said, George, says George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal by the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to make us healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more and healthier.
Evolution consists of spending the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality on my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution didn't necessarily apply to longevity.
They didn't necessarily afford the bigger or the stronger to the faster and even the more smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be able to survive if there were fish there, fish fish in the void, yet they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look back to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning that would be through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve many genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we can adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that we think about evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the natural kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces.
And the argument here is: the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we kind of <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive attractive possibility and scary possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected by us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose at individual and family level.
Think also that if it could be possible to be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome started in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> billion dollars.
By the next year of course, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of human genome at a cost to about 20,000 and a half a week.
Not much of them so that you can actually become the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only to protect themselves, but they're going to refer to herd immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine, with <unk> <unk> cell plants.
Can you imagine a good thing to go out of <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same motor of the science that can produce the changes in preventing diseases is going to allow us to also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to deal with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of hand this to the next generation and we could embrace the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can rotate it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next hundred years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have before them.
Are we going to use these choices for a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more enhanced and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing of all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight assistants here.
So he immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. Probably a <unk>
The pilot had already taken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot will cut the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that is not <unk>
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three most favorite words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set up.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was not for much -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also I gave my ego.
And I am sorry about time that I think about things that I didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as <unk> on that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please love it."
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die is not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
In that point I understood that when we connect those two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For mostly the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And it was given to me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying up today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to do, you still wait to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents than <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
It was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
And one day he came home and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a full paralysis of it.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation and animation, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he could be able to communicate to me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a pretty good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, you get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced myself to just a check, and instead of that signed up a check that I didn't have the least idea how I was going to <unk>
I got involved with her brother and her father there at the right time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony <unk> going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who have so much in your inner can't <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you are about that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving the things around one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world in the world of <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and then they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we <unk> we went to the University of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of cheap sunshine glasses that we buy in the shipping <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one percent, we published the code <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There's no hospital that I can say <unk>
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you that was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of moments of planning, Tony sessions came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of their life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he came back to draw his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out of there so that I could get it out.
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great thing, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix them and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, <unk> magazine recognized as one of the 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with technology recognition technology, I just recognized something and I got excited about wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are often very difficult and at the same time a dangerous amount of dangerous.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating it just -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you can have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a post on <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk from 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it is about and the content might be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But that was a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I couldn't have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could do anything -- nothing could be done for something as difficult as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I try <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> film ever <unk> is all up at the bottom of principle, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of brand X on the title, but we're going to make sure that we will use all of the categories we can on the film.
Maybe they <unk> a shoe and then become the most cool shoe you've ever heard.
The biggest car that you have to take on "The <unk> movie ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, to make them that <unk> the <unk> -- to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the complete film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea -- all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how sensitive people will be there.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One and a half million and a half million and a half million and a half -- I think it's going to be difficult the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing to convince a couple of big brands for them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time to go out of the movie -- let's look at it as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
<unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to get rid of the film or for me.
JK: I both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought it <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised me.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to give the product to as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the entire media scenario -- is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error -- and that mistake was this one.
Actually no, there was no way.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> simulation or easily detected or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> that are characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to doing it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk> -- like that weird bear that still continues <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want to take a story, but <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was obsessed with me at some lie -- and there's him looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take away from the subject and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to think of suddenly -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with the companies -- the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films and big, big, giant films that make small films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood say that the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm walking out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone else I can say you're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you with you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man as a <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen <unk> We're a little brand.
<unk> to the kind of little films that we <unk> we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: So we talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do you hold you fresh over time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the street man from the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good ones.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk>
<unk> something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the light colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I wear accessories.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part hippie part of the <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the pet guy.
They make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often joined the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings you are.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that we are going to do, like people around you, your family, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in and start in a place and in my case come and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like things different.
I like weird things. I like weird stuff.
A: <unk> of the <unk> for what is that?
What is the <unk>
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
It was a little bit about that.
A little more of you, that's not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think some companies are just going to lie in one of your strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to have -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually accommodate that and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> markings and brands that have gone and come around, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your brand identity identity, what would you be?
Are you an <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more well an attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are as playful as playful as playful as playful as <unk> contemporary or bold or bold or bold or bold or bold <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated <unk>
You're like, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You're real, stable, family -- safe, <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we use the magnetic resonance to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where you have forbidden advertising to the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no wall, there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are getting up into schools with community problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I've had the biggest response or in which I've been more successful at the ones that I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They'd succeed.
Well, since the movie was released at the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to make momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies in which we talk about to their clients will not be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take out the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train their employees in the loss of the risk is preparing their entire company to be getting out of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to give a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in an cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the peril.
From a <unk> at once, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
More than ever a little honesty is going to go along a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies all over the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so I <unk> on behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED of next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their largest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can engage these systems that are controlling speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> entered the gray box -- hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started doing research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems of control.
That struck us as attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working in that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better take the goal soon.
So we pulled out the ground code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> with people who obviously had all internal information.
And then you have all the points to attack.
And you probably even know how much it would do the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard <unk> <unk> it's complex, and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code of this code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, were calls for functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and try to engage them with the real world, with potential targets in real world.
We need theories about recipients we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories of targets, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find a number of thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant plant and <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I ended up in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that <unk> part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and put it into an effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> stands out in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better enough.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of <unk>
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with each other.
And so that it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a few weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would say to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making it spinning the rotors and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you a little bit of interesting things that we saw before, really <unk>
There's the gray box -- and you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is intercept the input values and the sensors of the pressure and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with fake <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's kind of like Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up video video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's actually much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is going to be speed, you must open tubes on a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
<unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> which disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
You can get more as possible.
And if you do that, you know, with what you want, is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main facility behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you skills <unk> or another one that makes users out of wheels and raise them back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force that increases its speed, and help, for example, managing the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> load of pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can rotate by 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design is able to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I think about what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back now to the users of my wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in roughly, in the wheelchair, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that will start their life -- to 20, 30 years -- <unk> a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is going down very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- because of a brain injury or something else.
And this has been like for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who's 19 years ago had an injury in the column, and as a result he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the board on board here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give power to the motors in <unk> and in the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural path.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing down the bottom of it <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the motion of beer.
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never <unk>
That's 19 years ago.
So I stole me up to the last little amount of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the 21st-century Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives closest lives.
That means that we all share an common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant of where the deadly violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has led for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation is actually not being able to fill and a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes -- the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them and for them to play is fundamental to build links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game apparently the roots are going to see the roots very <unk> the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple unique videos taken from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
I just think that in this case I love it, isn't it?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as well as humans.
And this video really is interesting because you know, this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how game requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think that as it does, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's the playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater creativity and cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes the world to play.
But let's go through the most of our game?
<unk> is not <unk>
Play is critical.
To bonobos and humans and humans, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like how much appropriate play, they can be the most <unk>
And so <unk> to accept this gift of evolution and play together as we support creativity, the friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the volunteer <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers belong to a highly <unk> staff to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to captain and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of the owner -- which is certainly going through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> her pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go inside and <unk> the dog house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people to go into a call to be a call to save a live living -- just because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
It was <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> and I went to the <unk> they had just finished the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for home owner -- where, as she was expected, his trove of more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from your home owner to be <unk> by the brave effort shown to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what was else was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer fireman is the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have succeeded, or they're going to get a very remarkable thing about success -- I'd like to remind you this: I don't hold on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something for give, <unk> now.
They were eating food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save life else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I went into the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete they built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the building blocks of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it was this thing.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per single person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
And meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to run the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, block, the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> that transistor was just for experts.
I personally didn't believe it that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets.
So you can't place it in the wrong way.
<unk> <unk>
The green is the <unk> the blue is the <unk> the rose and the orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can begin to make older circuits.
A blue guy with green is making light.
We can put a button in the environment, so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or <unk> just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> solar cells, <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light light work? And why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought back to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, that don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> Canyon, <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to do all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I've been time for time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that you are supposed to do, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They did great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
meet <unk>
This is a hydrant town in Boston.
Here it appears to be a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody gets caught up when you get caught up on the snow because you know it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to help this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, I was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that the citizens <unk> with shovels sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
You hold <unk>
When you do so, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, to see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to take <unk> of tsunami.
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why the citizens who are <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spreading without <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done in the normal channels it would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the <unk> of California that the time has gotten over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has a couple of days -- and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of a warning shot for the institution of the government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work -- not as private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, very open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the government of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to fit together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings on politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> What we do together because they were alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made it out of -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it would think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the health care center center and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It starts with animal control.
And then finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and you get a strong music and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So good for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a application, mobile and mobile web called <unk> <unk>
I don't want that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this is actually going to get this <unk> <unk> in my trash cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The <unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report was saying, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the U.S. income to collaboration to <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of thinking platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And I could have this connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor will help another, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animals, that cost a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think it's the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen for a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will prescribe our values and <unk> our needs, but we don't see it changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow surface layer.
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word is very contempt.
But this is what keeps us with that is that we funded as something that is operating in our against that other thing, and the consequence is losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make ownership sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report with 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have been faced with the government, it's time for us to ask, what world do we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we have to go where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everyone?
We can't get out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so that I, to <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of us are going to talk, they're all going to talk about.
They can express their views at any same channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem with no matter how to do hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They put their hands into the work to program applications that do better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be washing a fire hydrant, by taking a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to get those fire hydrants and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not just consumers of government we pay and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't get <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has to be a identity.
And the things they say here has impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them to feel about feeling, they can have special meaning to you.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American family in a dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he was power.
It was the last word in the whole family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been <unk>
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back and say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to give me back again and if I said yes, I left me in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I walked through the room, I took my hand and he said, "Come <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's go.
She said, "Now you know, <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and I looked at me and said, "I want you to know you've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do anything you like."
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just want me to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What I want you to think about is you would always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "All the second thing I want you to think about is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "All the third thing I want you to think about is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South rural. I have a older brother, and a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a pack of six beers, I don't know where the <unk> took us my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he was offered to my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You know, but I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I looked at it with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they don't really see sense.
We can't get them to do things they don't think to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My <unk> died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things which, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate of incarceration in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor and poor and black, you find so much despair, as much despair for these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> Los Angeles, and Baltimore Street, Washington, Washington, Washington -- 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that impacts the results.
And it seems to us very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger will cause us to believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, <unk> population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it back in the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before I was going to read the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility of coming out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people at the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, they have been asked to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Of every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and released from the death row.
There was an innocent rate of <unk> an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to never fly airplanes if every nine to the <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history -- I'm talking about slavery as well.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what he defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, you ask people to stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with it."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time I think about each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's good enough to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in Germany.
We will never be in here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we could never be able to get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, intentional and <unk> we can put us <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we be feeling in a world where a nation like Germany, you know, to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and the wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
And lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the people who never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
We have to believe that we have to believe that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being rational, so deeply committed to intellectual <unk>
By innovation, with creativity -- not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas from <unk> also by the heart of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader of <unk> talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities as TED, it must be <unk>
There is no <unk> related disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to truly be human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting to Rosa <unk>
These women were together and just to talk.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> calls me to go, <unk> comes the <unk> lady and talk.
You want to come and try it.
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom hanging out for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population of prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> me on my face and he said, "That's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been a great deal of me.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher at the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to him, is not to be a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> is not known to us by our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual or rational capacity or rational.
At the end of the way, the character of a society, not in the way as they treat rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were passionate about as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, "How can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One very late night I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old client.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a privileged white at 75 years executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put in that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> but he had sent the court.
A few months ago, I had forgotten it.
And then finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. She walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> "It's you.
And so I got sick and <unk>
And I stood up with the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the grade.
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk> And we started again.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that I had written these crazy things.
They arrived, the cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all furious because we're talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try and hear all that <unk>
You know, walking over here and so on.
Finally, this old black, with a head of worry, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
A 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> assistant showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man who keep her view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot truly be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, entertainment and creativity needs to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, you hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help you in your way, to do something.
Something is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to do an effort to provide the funds that you spend today in vaccine policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of cases of homicide <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, for safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, over the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you tell you what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the <unk> chain to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
I think our current philosophy seems to me about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've got excited to show you today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses gets so much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing is more than to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So from a <unk> of stories -- you know, looking at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood blood, you're very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news for seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, is no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe not.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> <unk> water shortage, and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long one, we just just had them.
Let's take the last century to see where we are going.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has become more than <unk> the average income per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, from electricity, transportation and communications, have fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people were doing it.
And we keep getting more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, no refrigerators <unk> computers, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So much of this is the technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I would put on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in sustainable depression and <unk>
It's the sum of fast computers that are used to build faster.
It doesn't stop to any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's curve up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> are called infinite computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all of the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the nuances of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, this at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can affect positive the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that stuff out of it, and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered with silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the end of the 1960s to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal as well.
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on an Earth-like planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about lean but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a <unk> photo. How do you <unk>
"A pale dot <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also an hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to give me your technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator as well.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any source -- saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'll do a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this is what I will be, Coca-Cola is <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation by this technology that exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has a better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan does 25 years ago.
And to tell a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars of <unk> video images, and music libraries and music libraries and music, diagnostic technology now is <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe I get the best thing to get in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X Prize, <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can make these technologies in a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there is no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device we would have a RNA or DNA <unk> which is not going to call the health of health and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk> billion growing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> you add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Khan and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if you are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal, can do things -- things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really amazes me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown that today's machinery of human patterns is better -- protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three new minds of new minds that are focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and to do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it up to the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one percent, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of some forest mangroves.
There were about 20 centimeters, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and was going on for a good moment, so it became more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters to the five.
It was a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing for changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad it was called the <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we took studies in the southern Sea Sea, and especially in the Aral Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny spots about <unk> remains that are coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line is a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were <unk>
Once we capture a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
We opened the starting point on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, so many of the <unk> <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that I found in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and so extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very abundant before <unk> it's not uncommon.
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a synonymous of big fish.
They become little frequent because the <unk>
And over time, there are just a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us have, like the captain of the present, like the captain such and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally use scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge paper that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the protected areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows you to erase their viewpoint.
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the West for example?
I think the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay Bay.
And you may have noticed that they're nuanced and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were <unk> with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I'll give, it's to Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made <unk> and what importance has that thing.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of those, it gets lots of views and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: makers of trends, of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of popular last summer.
<unk> didn't try to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There was a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this slide that I took the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> we present new things and interesting things to a larger audience.
<unk> <unk>  He's on Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to come in the end of a week,   <unk> on a Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be popped out of nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also on a Friday.
But what did this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or an creators group embrace a point of view, and they share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an suspended animation, with a <unk> music.
That's what it is.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three of three hours that have seen four million times.
And even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version version of it.
And then the international <unk>
Suddenly a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk>
What do you script might have been written by this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video for minute, just that only thing and unexpected can do it in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against <unk> in New York, I want to admit that I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you properly <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise and its humor, Casey Casey I got to get five million and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new approach that we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of creative communities of participation, creative communities, are the characteristics of a new kind of media of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't want permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but <unk> entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
words, for so much time, I was my friends, <unk>
They were <unk> in silence.
He died broken through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years old when her father died, and marriage marriage and two small girls.
To her, life was destined for a task to <unk> his family escape and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a <unk> four years that defies fiction, a boat was shaped towards the sea <unk> of ship vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear of the treatments, was the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were going, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> goes down in every wave, and the horizon vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the <unk> coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried -- because of the <unk>
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp -- <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set out to us in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is composed of addicts.
Unlike the middle class, whose existence I <unk> in <unk> had no sense of right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments between the people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't matter what was supposed to be <unk> who was usually <unk> was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> come back home."
By home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and we were hearing the movements of our grandmother at the home.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to help me.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> <unk> and <unk> boys and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer who was elected to me the young Australian woman of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the <unk>
As a <unk> resident from <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist who were invited to speak on sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose life would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines. And the comfort of life at a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a two daughters and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years ago, <unk> on the day of every single 20 years, and he's going <unk> the three in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the ship.
He hadn't been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you're not what you're not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about it -- more than to talk about.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the edge of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a little new in the scene -- and not just it's fine, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> a rare mix and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the who the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk> of soup that everybody <unk>
<unk> up to entry at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without their husband, without a <unk> to <unk> and taking the cause her own, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
Have you not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life <unk> we now can see that men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that to know?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a fearless thing in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that nothing guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see it, and you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and they would take off the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great Prince <unk> <unk> I had <unk> I pulled a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced it to magic.
And that would be a lot of that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I gave me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was to my <unk>
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We organize our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It took books from the age of 16.
And so when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we going.
They collect the text with the image of the image, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what is that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so this --  says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live alive thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood childhood, those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they shine your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag it towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the whole book, fantasy has always been maps, but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect of me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside of India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of shrimp for millennia, in an old <unk> <unk>
That's why we're bringing it back into a child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> with <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get this ritual of childhood that you have to go out and, in a chapter -- you get a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that you can put on the Web.
A boy from London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "We saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos you've been taking.
And inside the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are there a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a <unk> group that shows you about inner indoor plants.
At one point the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are linked to technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems because of all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's a very simple thing.
It's got a chest and <unk>
Every morning I got stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got a challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get married, send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time you need <unk> or a urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need lunch light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the used pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week to be available here.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will come up from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to regain the control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing rate of attention <unk> demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video of a video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
And then where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked us but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please get <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because you just open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use their iPhone, and the next weeks of using their cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce you, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to globally globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at the universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my passion before the drawing but was a little bit different because I used to use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction in a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful purpose but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can think of, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that does it seem real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Put the light?
What is it creating <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in conjunction can you create something that still looks like <unk> as if we existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture looks like it looks like it is that you don't even get the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to me, because otherwise something gets wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos should have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images played with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with perfect good.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that you find, because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find out the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made red the house on the top of the island to seem more <unk>
So to get a realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and it can be realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody that took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general way.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'll talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's a new thing.
Here's something that happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It takes more intensity because they write about paper.
Why do we <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or a unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say very much.
But if you look at it, for instance, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve -- it would be very dumb, would you see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transportation technology as fast as the <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development history that every few years of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these curves <unk> we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was a couple of things.
Or you will become a typical curve -- I know how to be something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all you can do.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
From being like that, we now would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way you adopt the world?
How new is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because you have to feel something that's going on.
It takes a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that I'm going to have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things over the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about two billion years ago when the Earth was a great sterile rock, with a lot of chemicals that went around around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals organized that we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that moment, had floating out of some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so the droplets grew up grew up.
They started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random election.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to incorporate chemicals -- they grow more, and they grow more chemicals and get more <unk>
Often they lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple chemistry, but things are interesting to be interesting when these drops of the <unk> trick.
In some ways we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to register what they were for <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people from airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and it would break it down to 22 times.
So if somebody wants to want to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then there was another big step in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming so much of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin in order to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to get communities that, in a way, they were together with it, and a few <unk>
In that <unk> way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community <unk> more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a DNA chain.
The following interesting stage for life took another billion years ago.
And in that stage we have communities -- communities of many different types of different types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell does not serve without heart disease, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and they were produced more interesting levels than our cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not more than processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> appliances that process the information that those cell cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> and understanding and to transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not at the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruits because he knew bad and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that we have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit of individuals.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those data structures sped up, enormously evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk>
I'm here sitting here sitting around emitting some <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your head that saved a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated that we made it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making abstractions.
We now move through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next stage the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The thing: the language, they took less than a million years.
And the thing: like electronics, it seems just a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent online advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it <unk>
I don't know that it makes each transistor in that gene machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the <unk> designers -- we thought a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and we put it into the machine, and it does something that you did before it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on chance?
You could run these instructions at random, and you could run all those programs, and take those of those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to the <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, just <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
They took those and <unk> the rest.
And now we have the best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we would have the children, that <unk> <unk> and that children will expand the properties of both programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
So let's go back again.
It was a few mutations going on.
And it tries to new and try another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in cases that are a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that sequence numbers is absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to try and see how they work.
They're brown light programs.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I have the safety of the fact that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets out a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> a plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become messy.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it goes ahead of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very <unk> of our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think stop here before I was born.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my fake <unk>
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
So it's going to be <unk> the <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it at the first base, not come to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who from 10 <unk> get it.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player on the League <unk> League in running over 400 <unk> in a regular cell.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and it's derivatives of a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and a dear thing has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is coming up to a cardiologist whose <unk> record is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting dramatically this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse from a nurse or a nurse <unk>
<unk> pretty well.
And the truth of the thing is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I would exist with the mandate of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
And so that was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman studied until a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the hospital residence in the General General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> and not usual.
And I even knew the technical diagnosis about how we classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the school school with the impression that if you did everything, then I would know everything, or as you can, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I were working.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to consult a cardiologist to go to the patient.
reporting and reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what struck me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it was not hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could be able to eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to give me <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I probably didn't want to be a resident to make a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made made was worse.
When I send her home, she didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse that I was taking care of Mrs. <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said <unk> "Yeah, I think I will be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up and the ambulance next to the ambulance next to their home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I went down to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did.
I went through the emergency service service.
And there was another nurse, not what I was taking care of my lunch lady before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most doctors in emergency emergency.
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: You know?
<unk> remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And then she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to her house, after I gave her the high, she suffered a <unk> and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought them into the emergency pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock of severe mind.
I just breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all of their resources.
They gave her medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
I had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days of it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had a permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, she left her to go. Mrs. mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was obsessed with it, and I experienced it for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture -- and I felt just alone, isolated <unk> because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would put things out and he made sure I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why sent it to her <unk>
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Little of that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day he was opened the sky and finally came out the sky and he was wondering if I felt better at me again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I had the efforts to be perfect to do not make more mistakes, I would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an activist, in the emergency room in a community hospital to Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
I sent it up to penicillin and sent him to her home.
But while he was headed to the door he was following his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my foreign change, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave three words: you remember you?
<unk> the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
So he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but the upper area, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He luckily, <unk> not <unk>
You get antibiotics on the Milky Way, and they recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until over and over again, and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it is a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
So it turned out to an X-ray of it, but it turned out a little bit of a colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and I called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I did it.
I checked it and to notice a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon <unk>
Both were operated on, and they recovered well.
But every single case I was pleased with is <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> which tells me what it really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a random party, talking about errors in other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, as a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> those who make mistakes -- and the ones that I know; they can't sleep and I know; those who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like the antibodies reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I made a personal study of poor medical research and errors in order to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the University Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work on a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where existing infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing the chaos and death.
In this country, they die in the country, they die by <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A self-organizing system, where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars -- not <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get <unk> and we eliminate all of the professionals likely to mistake, well, I'm not going to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> art is already a custom, saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone to them.
And his students <unk> <unk> <unk> my head and <unk> saliva and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> you can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, and they know it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people don't intend to <unk> but in a loving way and for support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, we <unk> errors.
And I feel a lot but effort to learn something that can convey others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick an average American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a long ago, in a research went on for a week to a group of CEOs in companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these CEOs and the time that we are involved in making decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every single work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of their choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the age of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How is the way to deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the energy overhead.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, you just raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your response is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very sharp store at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water -- and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I once asked myself, why never buy anything?
This is the shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy for all these <unk>
He pointed to me with tourists full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> just to the shop.
We had six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had been a 60 percent that when it was only six, about 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we found the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I was 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
Of those who stood when six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> you probably <unk> -- less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> in savings plans.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of annual funds, there were less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer the <unk> the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that we offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people would be educated by preventing stocks or hedge funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize climate well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences for providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make decisions that <unk> even when this is going against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for a contrast and a contrast of that awesome <unk>
Today I want to have four simple techniques that we have contributed to one way or another, in different research, so you can testing them in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard that before, but it has never been more true than today, less than today, less is more.
People always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space on <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is more and more of the fact that if you choose to cut, get odd options -- odd is going to be an increase in sales -- <unk> costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15 to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Brazilian Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major <unk> and less costs.
You know that supermarkets, on average today, they offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle better choices is the David <unk> David <unk> the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
The people who want to choose, are just <unk> not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options <unk>
The first thing I do is you ask <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience on a vacation of this audience to the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Any one that's ready to accept the supply.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit hearing more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was the most.
Because the images were made to look more real.
And this brings me to the second technique to manage the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 percent of 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more to it.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were becoming <unk>
And that gathering, was exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we appeal to the staff that you would think of the positive things that you would think about in your lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a New York Center.
We saw that in the supermarket. Over the <unk> of <unk> show can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This framework is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to you who we <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
Who are you supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase <unk> complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision that buys a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that lets completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions.
<unk> blue <unk> I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box -- four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order where the decisions are going.
So half of customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors -- just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the <unk> button on every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who go from many other choices at all, <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they're still there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> in all ways we make us to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the overload of the overload of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle a more categories of less <unk> <unk> of complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we will be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
You had to register a piece of text from example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much that we would do -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow print on each page that follow a pattern that makes them yourself inside and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the world online, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, which is a lot of big ones.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online cases, which would give money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to rob money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes <unk> online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, the protests, the protests, they motivate them about opinions, you laughs laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, they <unk> them as Anonymous that they do for protest and the last group are the national United States, governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority board of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives to one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people on the heart of <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how does people die from a heart of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign silver authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the U.S. protesters <unk> the Egyptian secret police based on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
And those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based in Germany that had sold in the Egyptian government tools to intercept the vast communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We had even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I don't have anything that <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's actually about privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trusted.
<unk> blindly in any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have been worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of American National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we would wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were people who protect our community and livestock and livestock and also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age six, is responsible for the livestock of his father, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid to be afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen out there.
I didn't make me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and they said, this thing is not going on here.  So I jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come from.
I found out that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with which you can turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp, a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity into the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see, you can see the core, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they are serving so much.
And my idea also is used now by all Kenya, to frightening each of the other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to conquer their farms.
Thank you to this <unk> I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the belly of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes someday and he told me that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got an opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when they <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know the fences were already invented -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, once you do it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the <unk> Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We go to <unk> on every single step in which I <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come back all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public school.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That was saying, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten them in the two weeks of past.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child who was sitting in her arms looking at the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end of a million North Koreans died during famine and only few people survived eating grass, insects and frozen cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark in the night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans, to cross North Africa.
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, in times.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with Roma families.
But I just thought I'd be a separate of my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North America were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was fascinated by the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the day, an official said to another, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And they left me going. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to find a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can do it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of divide.
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the university exam competition.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to the strength of a location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Asia.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went stuck several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of everybody and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South America.
I was going to come and came between the immigration office and police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man, asking me, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind <unk>
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I kept him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the <unk> people.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to protect them when they <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the emotion of hope that the <unk> people needs to need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came up in South Korea, and we came together.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical English practices, of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with their family yet, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans -- an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South University to represent something else, so they changed the way to Los Angeles as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.,  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk> land.
Just like it took millions of other Americans, I live in a food of food, Los Angeles Center for food places to get and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases that are dying in L.A.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see wheelchair chairs and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes of back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a piece of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters by 45 percent.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come in, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we joined us and we started planting our food of food, trees.
What we do, we are sort of a group of <unk> money made up of gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city looked at me, and in summary I got a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, on it?
A <unk> order for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I was not going to happen.
And L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It has <unk> miles of land.
That's 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plants.
Why on Earth does it look like this?
It took a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I moved to me to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to take my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Just like an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, I <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the plants are my <unk> of canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do.
You can't just imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witness how my garden became a tool of education, of the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> at night and they were in my yard, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by looking at people who was so close to me, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> doesn't temes people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I don't fear you're going to go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected it, and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant perhaps 20 <unk>
We've had a little bit of 50 people that come from, work and <unk> all of a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're sitting in, I see color guys that are on this path designed for them, which leads them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington will be produced.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it is not sustainable.
It's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to try and work to people, take the guys out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So how do you take your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me -- I'm not going to be sitting in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, which it rains very much.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're going on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent <unk>
The solution to that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, and the water can go through it, so all of the rainwater flow goes up to the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and they don't waste water -- never more.
Noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollowed out all the noise from all -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> see that on this road the surface of the surface of the surface go away.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and so on, and then then -- well, you won't do that.  But you can hurt her <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> light to <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and you will separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving around the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool into it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially the steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven. Because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
<unk> oven.
I put the shows, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So you donated a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> highway, <unk> in which we had to do a lane run to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
So we did older people, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> and then the <unk> and the <unk> and we came back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the lives of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's quite hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how the repairability acts work.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC news in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> she said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and they made the girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my eldest sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like we drove shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us hit a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
When the school was closed suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but even so, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan -- where her daughter, my mother, went to school, and so her father would hold it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was just about two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of her family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk>
For him, there was a greater risk in not education.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can <unk> your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than <unk> and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate me at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home by the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I'm wearing it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of an overwhelming opposition.
As a <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month, he and her daughter went from <unk> to his village, and literally, they escaped to being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to her house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would return to try.
<unk> now, if he <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the earliest <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school have been told, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid these changes didn't last a lot, after retirement troops from the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day, the girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten my grandmother's words who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime are carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown the courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of <unk> war, and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted to do, along with many other women, rebuild the <unk> <unk> <unk> and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after the <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of exile, I went to Libya and with a unique <unk> I started organizing workshops on development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we set out the <unk> of Women of Women <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> to advocate for the women's <unk> of the woman and by our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that were <unk> of selfish <unk> policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
The women won the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day there was the news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> and mosques <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the U.S. officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, shaped by an <unk> mentality is <unk> and it's removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all to talk to you about our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess today to confess that we, as nation, we chose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the choices needed -- that only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the collective depiction of the female and the female representation, of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but also to put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> the collaboration rather than competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> in the war, needs desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a <unk> fashion.
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in every single traditions of all the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans all of the humanity that men and women, that all the tribes and all the villages have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence.
And so he told us, "My <unk> stands for all things."
This is how to tell you, "My <unk> prevalent my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a single question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones that all do good for why she's left?
Why would anyone be going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I had had <unk> at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York to my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret <unk>
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I believed my alma mater, would me head to my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a heroic <unk> trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It might be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the <unk> <unk> list, Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all the religions, every single income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or saying in another way, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world who was staying with a man who sticks, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls are killed every year by partners, <unk> and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, January night in January.
I was sitting next to me in the New York City in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me as on that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a field of the field.
He had a few big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> in the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything of me, which was a list that I had been to Harvard, who had gone to Harvard, who would put a passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as a woman, as no one had done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your spouse, so I <unk> I quit my work and <unk> and I went inside Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a physical trap and financial trap <unk> ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those weapons come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to feel so safe he bought three guns.
One had in your car <unk>
Another was kept under the pillow in our bed and the third time in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns from the trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I never got away my hand, my life was already serious risk, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very upset by the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never got to hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
I was the first time I was driving into a secret beach and she <unk> and he gave me so hard in my head that I <unk> several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our moon of honey would go around the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to my face.
<unk> he kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone anywhere.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we, to us, our victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the <unk> cases of domestic violence happens after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to become married, "Get out of financial resources, and to their children, who are usually obliged by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> his mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not doing?
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and family friends, full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you who were <unk>
We have the tendency to apply to victims as the victims of <unk> women -- women who were <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
Some people are a way to say "The fault is her by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> men who want to be <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened and that they will take their lives of life and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor, of a domestic domestic domestic violence.
I went to marry a guy and kind of, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to ever more, is a gun loaded with my head in the hands of someone who says it wants.
In this moment, the same as they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid time, but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk>
The <unk> may be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy personal love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last appeal to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse just in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light over it.
The victims we need to all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of light talking about it with your children, their colleagues of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people who have fantastic <unk> future.
Let's take the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show to the victims of safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe, and they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call <unk> <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have been dressed like that.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
And if some of the women are getting <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go back now, but find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. These are very <unk> less evil than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater through the head, because it's when you're laughing in me, so you don't do anything as I cover my mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that she <unk> my back and <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our look, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic responsibility, and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, which is only less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question people always ask me is: Can I be a model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the American American magazine or the next executive director, or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you know, you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike synthetic surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a copy of your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your backs, no matter what they <unk> I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but your copy <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look like weird.
The next question people always ask me is if all the pictures were <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was going on, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So it looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
These are <unk> of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too much a three-inch heel. And I would never use, except the start, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I forgot to take money, and I forgot for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
I think of these privileges because of my way, I don't know, and there are people who are paying a price for their appearance, regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, teenage people who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
By doing this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to 78 percent.
So the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little closer, and you have the bright hair -- you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe the <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask them to ask you, with some thinner legs and the bright hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> hair and clothing <unk> but they're probably the <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was my best enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures <unk> and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no <unk> directors and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of care.
In fact, most of them took some vegetable tourists random.
My story begins when, in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture of holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter, and my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a full stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, luckily, no one has ever dreamed of the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life this journey would change.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in the way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than performances of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a summer week, and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only at physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always put the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see the life through their eyes, and how it feels and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when he suddenly came into dry my tracks and pointed into a red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he described to me that I had meaning at the age of five years in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart with force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I don't want to go back to somebody and asked them, and it takes us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why have they such a bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as a <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> and <unk> applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to the Parliament.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't have clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are primarily in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 facing a high risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important, first of all, providing vital ecological services, <unk>
These are our <unk> <unk>
They were sending the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all bacteria. They help to absorb anthrax that will not be used by them and cause large losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no shading -- the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the protective and <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the upper and lower Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> Tasmanian devil goddess <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> they provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six of them are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there's conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of danger that means that in less than 10 or 15 years they're <unk> and the reason is because they fall from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a broken drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs on the street <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge car bomb, you have a large time bomb, the number of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're doing these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel around different countries, so I focus on a locally new problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
It's very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do -- my life -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set in in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I was going to do.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local tomatoes to grow Italians and <unk>
And of course, people weren't absolutely interested in doing that, so that they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't <unk>  We were just as much as the local ones, in so fertile valley, it hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't get anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here."  They spend time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Italy, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came out of the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> you never <unk>
I thought that only we were Italians all the Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they were doing -- what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  So let's see the waste that would be <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has been <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we have done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
Yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if you were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if you were my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. He gave me a little bit of <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever confuse anyone, you will ever become a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and they sit with the people of <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a cafe. We joined a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, they would tell them, but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what a chance has <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
People who are smarter than their community, you don't even know it -- because they don't take their public <unk>
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is the family of the company, the family of the business, which is <unk> with you in your house, on the coffee table, and it helps help find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West people.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this <unk> junk where we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see for the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really hard.
I was <unk>   So --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> company.
The planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you have gotten more of this tomorrow?
People local <unk> That's what you <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we have the fossil revolution, <unk> <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of fighting <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in a journal <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> he got together this group of people -- and I think about what would happen to New York City in a hundred years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already infected in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would save the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States arose -- <unk> political companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they don't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you a absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I later have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell -- has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies icons on the Carnegie world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one -- no one was started by one person.
I would never be <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of <unk> business in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, what should it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do it." <unk> you would look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't change much knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give rise to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and trust a city.
It will always accommodate the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the greatest number of abandoned properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so forth.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time that I lived and I lived in the time.
He told the significant things about my current life.
But <unk> for this look in my everyday life.
It seems to be easy to be catching up on day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this very abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line.
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you once more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue of it.
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people asked me to laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It is about giving accommodate the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit where they have now been done in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to conserving perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
Education is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that would be more power.
It's going to think about the death of our life.
Our spaces can shared better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope and with more means to share fears and stories, people around us cannot only help to improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
I don't speak, but it transmits better joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It's called <unk> happening what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at skin color.
It doesn't matter religious differences and notice about this: it's never <unk>
When I sing the songs of our childhood, trying to say to the words that I can't even remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's a very <unk>
Do you get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
She doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and I want to pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday <unk>
You don't find that?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds are not fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case, even though that was the case -- it could only mean one thing: that were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
So in every individual shapes it differently, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster rises in the world, there is no cause no cure anymore.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new way to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that I would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> an pure nature and incentives -- a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there has been some tough moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that these are things I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, it's autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies on the moment we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a <unk> teacher who gave a kind of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> indeed.
But in fact, those conversations, I felt what <unk> should have felt when she fell through the hole of the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are those who are attacking our biggest challenges of energy and health care and health care -- and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the web structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, caring about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as dumb ones.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly in their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is using examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways to turn it into their content.
And when you present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported too in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then then provide graphics that supports our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some key key ones that can help us that others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all means, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English Oxford <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge -- no matter how it looks for <unk> platform, and that when I wins, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that they said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he was able to read it, but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal moment.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
It was introduced all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people simply wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even with it -- they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired -- because this debate would be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get out of power.
They didn't want to call him King as he was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give him the more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that you came in.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, <unk> <unk> we can't call <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take serious with a <unk> and insignificant title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't survive.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that you can go and wait for them to be <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want you to <unk> it is that President of the United States doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, and the largest economy of the world and a fleet of unmanned air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed at the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn, and that I would like to take you to you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changing the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at a <unk> in an illegal mine of Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's difficult to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that <unk> <unk> and stones with <unk> tools.
Like everybody else, I take a cheap light of light -- he holds his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met some days earlier, who lost the control and dropped countless meters on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at the deep hole their lives without paying or reward and, often dying.
I walked out of that hole and went home, but they might never be able to will, because they're prey to <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is engaged to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world, but not to such a degree.
When we end up talking to me, I was very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me just <unk> and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many these places.
Some of them were even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the whole bunch of slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 days.
However, today, you can have been given entire families for generations by <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery makes profit over <unk> 13 billion per year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake good promise promises of good education and better work to find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and they can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the produced goods produced by slaves but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost all over the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange, weird show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, the fact -- entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their head, and they take them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task over and over again for about 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no waste for eating and not to drink, or to drink, I was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment better than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was next to me very quickly, grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it." Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation of what they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their release and he trusted you to do it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids hauling rocks for <unk> in <unk> to <unk> until they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children who charge and children were sending them to their heads with straps and <unk> made by <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
Do you have nothing like that?
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they had completely their homes.
When you hear the word slavery -- we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness told me that it would be difficult for me to work with safety in this particular business.
In <unk> I was interested in women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It took me for some stairs <unk> that gave this dirty, <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for forced colonies.
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to come to clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each wearing is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of acute acute fear -- and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is all around us.
There are hundreds of people who are killed in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families involved in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of it.
<unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and thrown the silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My translator told me her stories.
"We have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> <unk> in Lake <unk> the world's largest lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older sons, some younger children, some younger kids.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work <unk> extensive on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> the topic that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The <unk> branches of trees were plunged into Lake <unk> often fishing networks and children, <unk> and with fear, it's thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of them were <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to be younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were asked, but they had been working from the one thing.
<unk> at night and <unk>
And I would point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> the <unk> were <unk>
Kofi <unk>
Who will come to be because of someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike, and suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to take it through a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started <unk> we removed the <unk> and then after walking around an hour when I was going to find out the way I was going to find that the way was struck by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos about my head as I went into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of workers.
Many women had children strapped to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy heavy bags that then will be <unk> to another area where they put the rock to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer close to the side, we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this <unk> victim and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When she died his uncle, I was able to inherit the debt of the uncle that force him to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I was working in the <unk> <unk> and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being liberated and civil activists for local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light about slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will deliver testimony to them, and that we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult for atrocities like <unk>
These images are not magazines -- and real people like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force on a fire and that fire will light up to slavery -- because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a particular problem for anyone who <unk> we are like management centers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
And that's why I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the more human activities.
We gave us the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we will see later on.
But it demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill, and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at its time, was a <unk> dance show.
In the last few years has been moved on to treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an <unk> weakness <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in the objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's quite frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement aren't all markers and so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never have ever done.
What if patients could do it at home?
So that would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could be done to be done ourselves?
You wouldn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to be with you as a conventional way, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to speak, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal vocal sounds because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound, and we all have the genes that we need -- for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the organs.
On the bottom of you can see an example of a rough shake from solid ropes.
We see the same <unk>
I shake a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of these are <unk>
The neurologic test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They are both <unk> OK, but also <unk> examinations are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's the minimum cost and we all know what happens.
And when something takes a cost that <unk> it comes on massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the hard difficulty of patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
By monitoring <unk> we could get an objective data.
We could make massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's Parkinson's Initiative in <unk>
<unk> with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these targets.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> can call at low price and <unk> for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached 6 percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you will be able to say who is healthy and who not?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you're not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it?
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion by looking for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> in this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job and now has been shown to be working on the mobile phone network, too, what I <unk> the project -- now we have a 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, into no windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the robotic models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more <unk> we do the perfect possible one, and we could get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a true taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the events that were going on in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where he was voluntary there was there in the room working as part of the response team.
And I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 to <unk>
It's a small fishing village in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level went over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people were crushed.
We set up rubble and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish fish -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
We care and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found things like that.
They found pictures and photographs of photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he came out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center.
It helped clean the toilets, gigantic giant toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that it was going to be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond <unk> but it wasn't until occurred to me as my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who were more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab on the lab, couldn't help but think about how to fix it, how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and met hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night walked on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- I knew we needed to try.
So we started tweaking the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had gone down, the face of the girl had to make up with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of the time, they came to be more kind of pictures and they needed more <unk> and this is that I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people outside <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in libraries of the temporary and the temporary model of <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time I think about <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could offer an hour, I could be a weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw very much hand using a guide areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures takes up in saltwater, covered in bacteria with seaweed, even oil, all of this thing along with the step of time -- I continue to give it a hand part of the project.
We couldn't tinker with the picture unless it was clean and <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky at <unk>
We tell the guide of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were kind of kind of like the photos.
He had started <unk> her himself, but he stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to test the images in one photo and tweaking the whole picture.
When they picked up their pictures with some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures on a department station, between the rubble quite far away from where her house used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his younger son was 14 years old.
For that, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look at, something that I could remember from the past day that I would not have been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to them, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them went back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, someone wanted.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to us, but the first thing they would take to look for.
This is the project, to restore small bits of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that you're getting in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger -- to give you something, using their talent for something that are not very thin models of perfect skin.
So to end up I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I sent back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl and gathering around a baby, I was passionate about, because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs is the same.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple in an apple in a billionth of a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a very fast technique that can create videos by slow light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without the <unk> and they actually challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I'll switch it into a <unk> second, and it is a number of <unk> to create a photo array <unk> just one millimeter alone.
And that piece of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a regular <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package package and we shoot this bottle, how they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk> chamber.
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel in the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photo package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally arrive at the lid and then explode it in several directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, waves travel on the table, and because of the reflections of the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> <unk> and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow slow movement.
And what about testing <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table and the tomato wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature has a picture, I thought of a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes can see a <unk> photograph.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as light goes off the tomato sauce, it is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces on your inside and go back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your phone, you will be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo to <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one, so you can barely get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons photons and we recorded over and over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those pieces of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera.
We could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, there's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like that quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what extent it corresponds to how a distance.
When you project a laser can record a picture of <unk> which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that will save collisions with what's going around the curve, here.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of tissue and blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science art -- a art of photographs of pictures.
And I realized that all of the pieces of data that we collect every time is not just for scientific progress, but we can see it.
To create a new form of computational photography with slow and code code.
And look at those waves -- Remember, the time between each of those waves in one of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But here is a little bit of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order where events happen in the world sometimes is invested in the camera.
You know, the corresponding sphere of space and time, can we correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you free freedom.
You can <unk> a <unk> crime in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
You can record a song, you can record a song, and you can get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people will come together for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people were gathering that they are looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of your mind have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up on your <unk> <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of all today having a cell phone.
But today I talk about me, my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This board says that every company, the European company, every single Internet provider of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information information.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, and there were lawyers, journalists, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Germany in East Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to asking, and I got to ask them, and I didn't get a particular answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give it a lawsuit for because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give this information.
At the end of the end, I still agree.
They demand the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> <unk> the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And the CD had this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 information lines of information.
And I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Country City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and knees and go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on the train to <unk> and what I often call in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me between them.
And then you call the other one, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicates each other to what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if I had a <unk> who would have known who the leaders were -- this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe I'd never happened.
And as a result, neither fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the chance to follow our lives, and they want to adapt them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you come home tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their cell phones to remind them that they have to fight the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, Nicholas <unk>
It's not enough.
Hi, Nicholas <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to give you a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any one of the present there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go walk.
Christmas Christmas -- you're in the shopping mall, drive in <unk> and what do you see?
The 16 empty place for disabled people.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I've got 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was no <unk> of the <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim disabled disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first.
I also love to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in "you not se se se se se speaker.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters would be <unk>
If my three sisters older were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were complaining that I was on the outside of it, and if I didn't know the ultimate note -- I was going to get my mother's <unk>
My dad taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to do it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and they were every family.
There's now 20 and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed <unk> a lot of hunger in <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so <unk> of the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am as well.
And when my friends were going to spend a summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine every single <unk> we would get them in <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was about <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I would put me into the back, and I was inspired by the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before you <unk> it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand on <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass lobby of my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have paralysis, <unk>
At the end of it <unk>
Thank God <unk> in order to be <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, <unk> crying historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I could not do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that literally was born and gave an actor to have a brain <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At <unk> I returned home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> directors are not <unk> <unk> not white, with disability.
Just give you perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell on the account of New Jersey on the front of New Jersey with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs. And I was also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little sound that says that women are not fun, and they're very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you to <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma <unk>
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program on the cable back with Keith <unk>
I walked in as if I was a graduate dance, I went to a studio and they sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the desk desk to not go out of the screen on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like I was actually going to be a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
A fun thing that I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that the kids are <unk> but I never fall away from me and no longer <unk>
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I read clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> terrorist <unk>
What does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as the race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
Yet we have grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we could create more positive images of the disability and in the daily lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may even use the whole society to teach our children.
My brief, journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was a depiction of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give children to Palestinians a tiniest little bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me living alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little village at the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
drought, drives the little village to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there is no work, no way out of future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing like that.
One day you read about a man who offers him to <unk> after dinner, after dinner for dinner.
Let's take a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes -- money to send home to her family.
They present a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky -- <unk> a bomb.
That boy of that little village with the dreams of the large city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little town of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it from what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great sleep in the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't care about opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism is to be the story of cities to 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the youngsters is <unk>
70 percent don't work is not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit a Hospital hospital where I was born.
I remember being in that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few youth leaders in a business table.
<unk> about 90 percent juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a choice of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the youngsters in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> it was <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a graduate college student, so I was a perfect <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorists, in order to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> the local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
So why is this story?
What makes this different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was trained to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those that they grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding games, by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in creating the first public park <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged to believe that they could be a entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of <unk> culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and put it back in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than to start a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park on <unk> is how it comes to how it is called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain the motorcycles for it.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is that my suggestion is to turn the youngsters in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it wouldn't be on the path that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four feet of apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had said, who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where you were going, who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash -- to <unk> tons of waste and two tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through her pathways, and I walked people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to get a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I read them.
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continued to get the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage every weeks.
There's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> collection collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into the traffic all day and pass it around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And then the garbage itself is full of dangers that are often falling from the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also as a way of breathing or circulation.
It should always be moving.
And it's also about the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> are the most important piece of work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protecting of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts taking away from their containers and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries they start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have room for what the economics drivers start to fail when it's in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to point its relationship.
And then there is what I call our average public rate, necessary.
So I mean by just the speed that we used to get used to get used in the time <unk>
We usually do not <unk> we can't clean it, and we have our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water <unk>
We use them. We forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about collection collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> stigma in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste collection on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that, I started to research the waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we made them good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and realize all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste -- what we think of when we're talking about crap. represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see to someone whose job is to clean the garbage on you, take a moment to get <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where the architecture is naturally born of the conditions and the local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to leave <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the surfaces with crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it is a temperature that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, its aspect has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site the site, which is located in a very much growth zone of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, put all the entries from the building.
And this is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that would spread through its own shape, of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue like a concrete concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of dresses in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and that helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave air and light in a very controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not very easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because the end of the time there was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of urban.
And these <unk> on the roof, they collect water for inner sanitation.
You wait for the early next year, because we go through the fifth floor floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest one I ever designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also the environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve access gates connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets together, creating 12 initial blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of <unk> gates with straight lines, and that changed the initial model.
And the last operation, it was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and so much natural ventilation.
So we would take a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks of <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local rules that set up greater density at higher levels and a lower density at the lower plant.
And it reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like to give the community the space that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and they can do activities like run a race of two miles in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was super strong for state capitals -- very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> of the school. I was a little evening, and I stood up in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my masterpiece, the book of grades.
And then I did.
I took the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the things --  And I set up to give me the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other roommates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put you all rows of <unk> and I just got a row out there, just for being there, because he <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never bother me.
It was all <unk>
I never got <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> that was so small, it was so good for me.
It <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that observe loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab to study <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> it would have no literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would have no king <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the lists of reading school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is fashionable -- I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the advances that they have all of them.
This year you're doing a hundred years of their work <unk> "In search of the time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot about how <unk> it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel, and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a <unk> database.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
As <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details that are <unk> to put the knife in, right?
<unk> do all <unk> <unk> and that's something that I was able to understand.
All that she makes to give me pleasure to others, maybe right now."
And he starts saying to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great <unk> <unk> and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of sudden listening behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's really scientific research with <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for the truth, a truth, a really painful. In fact, what <unk> <unk> the better the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs who we need -- who makes us suffer, causes us a range of much deeper feelings and vital than a man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to go search for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some of the other emotion that teaches us to look very <unk>
Freud would write on this later on.
One day, Freud visited by a young young man who was being asked by the idea that her wife did it.
And Freud said there was a strange thing in that man, who is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or don't accidentally stand up with a man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of your wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely we are, the more we are, more we become the state's residents.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which he would send awful messages to itself, for a year.
For a year. It's all a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of her former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big if you <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try and <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his more famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to invade from your self and <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your rings, cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route for Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good at the social networks, citizens of where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask, for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius but something.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it <unk> it and <unk> them with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> it <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to get your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> relocated in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, no emotion.
You know, at a <unk> minute on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could I still be so simple?
What if <unk> actually are a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> from the greatness of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as long as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction fiction, jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July July of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the Apollo module.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the surface of the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest deal in peace times in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars from today, or four percent of the federal budget.
So Apollo did work to 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
People died, including the Apollo crew <unk> 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on their surface, which stood after Armstrong death, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
Not a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 minutes later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy President wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the very words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn into our goal?
And you might also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why does he play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of Apollo Apollo was not just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> in the face of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological judgments.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it <unk> the <unk> and we eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
During most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> flew at 40,000 miles /
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo <unk> 10, and the passionate optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagined that technology was going to be able to go to Mars, create a clean energy, heal cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the tube exhaust.
I knew surely that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was absolutely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that out there, it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard that for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had found us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But not the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> and <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer business people.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused by the creation of ideas of ideas of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they prefer small investment investment, minute that they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, that they need a huge capital and development of development in the long term. They don't have invested in developing technologies to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewables like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of energy that can compete in price -- don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what politics and international treaties is developing a significant rise in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of the current political climate that we see an Indian energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they are not to be.
We know from time ago that famines are a result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the crops or the systems for the storage and a deal of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president was likely to be declared cancer War on 1971, but we soon discover that there are many types of cancer, some awfully resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population needs to want to solve the problem, and the institutions must support <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we should understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it has to do with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition in the Cold War, in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how difficult and dangerous and there is no popular mythology of science fiction to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a big decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a clearest idea on the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have dropped down in some activities, or institutions and could have increased in others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to the opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there's not a lot of evidence.
I mean, people who have been <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost in the middle of the road.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you say?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes, that people find it when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody would give you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
And probably <unk> by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust the some, but in other not."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in the way.
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> <unk> or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, to say that I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence level -- because they try to encourage the good inherent trial to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to be more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with rightly called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a clever goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, that means that what it matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If I do that, I haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do before you trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, and all kinds of institutions, which made us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I will look at <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the accountability system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and testing <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably know the similar examples.
It was all about the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you try to be trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do that if you're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is <unk> because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the scores enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you cannot <unk> usually by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to do <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's a day, everywhere, what makes people common -- the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving <unk>
I wear them and get me back the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they have become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you go back to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I hadn't <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
So first created this tool that will be reflected in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But the two hands stay still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
He <unk> a transparent camera bombsight to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor, which is down on every floating screen.
The architects can reach or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us would have been bought and process things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel in the time.
This magnet, <unk> is behaving as a pixel in 3D space, which means that so much the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And when we plan to digitally repair the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and at the distance, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks. This is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer of the computer is to imagine how to program the world to change our physical activities together.
As you can see, digital information, not just show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us having to get ourselves from our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that's our imagination.
Thank you.
I moved to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to teach a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they create firmly believed that there was only an immediate path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer singer in my dream.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer needs to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me.
Only my friends would me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing you might aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me, I wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came in in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to see here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> It's about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told you, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> relationship to my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
They have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me, because this is what the students in China would learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if reading math worked for research, why not do it as well in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, the <unk> are economic and politics and spiritual.
For Buddha are all <unk> lust, fear and duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of missing in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know it won't come back or powerless never.
Having a broken dream, is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that you come to dreams, where the passion, where your happiness comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which I am today, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a 12-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> I threw off the couch from my office and took off the shoes and he told me I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy just to move your head while we get to the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I saw it, she was right.
You start working later, you go home after that, she has children later, until the death happens later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to have a while.
But shortly later, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex that would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was to marry him."
And so my squad <unk> said, "No no, but maybe he would be standing on the next thing.
Also, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yeah, people feel head after what they would do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to age without going through the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes!
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take off the dream -- I want to see. It's fine. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
So this means eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments that shape their life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future couple years.
We know that the brain ends up in the second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time in life and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28 and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence
<unk> were asking for <unk> names to <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole you with that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, the interesting person as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as you start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day that I graduated from life.
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My dating on the <unk> were like their chairs.
All running, and they were all running, but then somewhere around the 30, it crashed the music and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the age of <unk> and so many of you start a career, to pick a city, to pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The average age of <unk> it's not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which was more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
He often gets often in our sessions, but then she was getting up her itself to say, "You don't pick your family, but he can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma came up on her head and cried for almost every hour.
I had just buy a new book book out there, and I had spent the whole morning with her many relationships, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> please call <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if he gives me <unk>
At that time, I was a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the age of Emma sitting front.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> men or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who would be <unk> of that identity of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital -- I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the race of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that should not count, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I said to Emma tribes that are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are just limited to who you know what you know, how they think about, how talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes out of the outside of their closest <unk>
The new things come from what they're called weak links from friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have any work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job with not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not less important, Emma believed you don't pick your family, but they know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon send her family to her family, when she has a partner and it is her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better old enough to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live right now, or you get older, now when all on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who is <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a <unk> <unk> who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped to get a job in there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who living alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special from events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and send me a letter that said, "Now the emergency room of emergency room are not sufficiently <unk>
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy for you.
The <unk> are kind of planes coming out of Los Angeles, who go to some place in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
Similarly, at the same way, at the age of 21 or at 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the smartest idea of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> as Emma all <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> and get identity, get your weak ties.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very technical job in <unk> <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to <unk> students in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, <unk> tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the job would go, <unk> grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance had no job <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in <unk> in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if having successful school in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast and soft way.
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going on as far as possible on competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in slums. What teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private businesses, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came out of a feature as a very important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at the top.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked the thousands of high school students who did this, and then I waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every single aspect that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing -- even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little bit that we know, how little people know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How to development in children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job ethic <unk>
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related to whether or it's even related to recognition of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try to start all of them back with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined to make our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my wildest memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was obsessed with this incredible language.
But for a foreign language, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and fast method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic, <unk> <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to it.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand the 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic traffic signals -- <unk> to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting in a <unk> way, <unk> I'm <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> of the way it's called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates in the old West <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It is an act as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker speaker, is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> together, it gets too hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking you questions.
<unk> touched there is someone at home?
This person is coming out of a hidden door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical ones, will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, to be able to learn a couple hundred characters of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun right first, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two stacked mountains one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a job.
A mouth that tells you where you're going to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind us that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie mastered its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and carrying a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex of a child show of <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy, and a <unk> boy would <unk> a girl in his own <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
You use magical shoes to defeat the <unk> they generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the magician magician is that the most popular characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so slid in the room, and he was struck as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be value issues, perseverance and <unk>
I should feel that Luke one to an army to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> of <unk>
How does it win in Dorothy their film?
To do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much strength of the capital that is going to be force in movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected the credits because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess before anyone of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend them from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as well as lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war movies.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues in classic in classic and classic every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who are raising a child.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not going to be roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist. And in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character that has line?
So, you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality -- it was <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success <unk> an idea of consensus what a movie <unk>
<unk> does not test the <unk> test.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie -- I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So I went through the numbers.
In 2011, of 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women have chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this one that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was saying.
In the United States, one out of five women says it's been sexually abused in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids to have something to do with it.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our <unk> like <unk> <unk> and we hope that it will -- but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Star Trek character for him.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just brilliant.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was looking for the sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I was terrified of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea <unk> had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to look differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we can use <unk>
This is a place in the eastern eastern east.
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of construction materials and the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, ancient <unk> called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous side of <unk>
This area is huge, it's roughly <unk> per <unk> per mile.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find at random it would be the equivalent of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see within the circle here, which we thought could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of sample on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we looked for layers of human occupation for human occupation look up.
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of mud we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location location -- five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred feet away from the Middle Empire.
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones used in the jewelry, the Middle Empire. These are the stones that <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes off the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have some evidence from the elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle East, it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So as TED as TED, I was founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really happen in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found out of the top.
It actually puts <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made.
Now we would take a group of <unk> obese on cars.
They are racing on a <unk> race and they go to their front door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays from the wheels that ends up in <unk> places -- <unk> the threshold of the door.
And the lobby, or what he is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
And from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> they tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you have a point of getting into the mouth.
<unk> over one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and doing the most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over his middle center, singing <unk> One More <unk> One More <unk>
Now go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow bricks and from the oven. They come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len was "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> hoping that this was like the end of a wise <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies from different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> <unk> just once.
It <unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
There was whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best memories for <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts by doing a few years ago by Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize the <unk> and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach the Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in a deck of <unk> in national television.
That will prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year I don't just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember he had a <unk> problem.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he was based on the <unk> <unk> film <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties about writing memory does something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not such a rare thing as it can be like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed dramatically, and I would say that they have changed us as cognitive as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of <unk> memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people are.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know -- Is it having brains in some form of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> test, and the answer was actually not.
But there was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control that we <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, you take your brains as you look at it as <unk> numbers, and <unk> <unk> they found that in the memory champions you find out that in memory champions all over the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive <unk> is managing as an arms race in which every year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory champion of memory.
In their desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards that he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the very precise command <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used to the end is cut down to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It turns out with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox, <unk> says this: I tell you two people you remember the same word. I tell you to you, <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I first go back later, and I wonder I asked you that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who said to him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance about their head.
But the word, <unk> <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They are okay when they return home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some extra time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes 2,500 years ago in <unk> Greece in <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who did a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't show a poet.
He stood up -- he would come up with his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon he was, the hall of the <unk> got <unk>
They went to everyone.
But not only killed all of us, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't have the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, one survivor, in the middle of the rubble, shut the eyes and realized that with his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the family from the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering or phone numbers, or instructions -- for word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby, would be capable of <unk>
The idea of the Brooklyn palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory -- in the same way that I would have done it <unk> if they had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition is completely <unk>
And then you can imagine getting into their house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> over Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote <unk> they want to count.
And then you could fly in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their speakers, not the word for word, which is going to confuse but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in their <unk> memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
But seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting on taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put in her place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sitting to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was a lot of fun.
I would never hope that I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it really is about doing is better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a little bit of safety goggles. leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered in a year before, and I had the idea that I could come in, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speakers, and phone numbers, and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are so just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to get to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You get to focus on what we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of full attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today -- is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side, are going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are capabilities of incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject -- so it <unk> only a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave to the living room.
And so everybody spent the time watching the television. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I went down, and I would get involved in one towel and you all see me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> safe and hated it.
He would take that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and of those areas, but of those emotional connections emotional that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice ourselves.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it, because we were in a building that's built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an amazing emotional connection, and we've used this trick for a long time long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, solid vehicles in the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, and you know, it has this round thing, and he has this round thing, which is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, had been finished with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for living forms of life.
We gave them and we gave them so much, that we get out of the people.
And all of the black black, you think that we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and get back with those <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, and so we began to experience <unk> we do <unk> the pendulum back and over and over again, we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started adding those symbols.
I took the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won on boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
The <unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial malls we moved into the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic dreams.
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian.
Maybe with an infinite number of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
We have the symbols of <unk> now we have new design techniques that we have a computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that would become against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, I was going to go back in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical <unk> and public and general crowd were completely aware of a building.
New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism on Bilbao increased in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles Seattle, Seattle, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical forms, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials happened with some other star.
I went to <unk> and what happened with these few architects of elite architects in the <unk> the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is actually transported beyond their physical location.
<unk> is everywhere right now, that means that the communications speed has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if the one that designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's what we found with buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they would do.
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the means of communication, it starts <unk> increasingly to be on both extremes to <unk> and they actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the audience.
Now we can make the symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant two years before the building, I was already part of the community, and as drawings looked like exactly the product -- it was exactly not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, and the building stopped being just a building, it became a middle of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to upload these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of us <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment, innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are already not those mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and complicated drawings -- and you're no longer an <unk> public who doesn't embrace something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by the architecture.
That means that the fear of a style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture story, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick with ideas of what you should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we ultimately will be ready for the ways they will produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to do sport or for <unk> or even one can be married at night.
This means that three architects can be <unk> in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars from the community around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go there.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She actually loves her reflection.
It laughs and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. When did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly taste our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week to school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells you and what his friends or colleagues say, they don't know who you believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he says to others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has been more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenage teenager that gets these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly young girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what's leading to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, and available all the time -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous basis, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that's going on with that is <unk>
This environment, to be always connected -- is our children <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they have.
There is no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk> <unk>
What is the greatest thing in somebody's life versus what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are covers of the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And so like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see with what young girls are.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the superheroes stars of sport, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These aren't <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to taxpayers and the business development field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenage teenagers are not interested in the class.
One in five are not attending classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you can see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, you get a lower note at the average of your fellow people who don't care about that of appearance.
And this phenomenon has spread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gives up irrespective of what these young men actually weigh together.
So, to be clear, we're talking about how you see you not how you are.
The low self-esteem about your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, more diet not healthy that they can take you to a food mess of food.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like meat and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, aesthetics, sexual relationships to ages and no protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs us billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
So let's make this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have a positive impact, but also a natural impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but to address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are viewed and talked about in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that purpose or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people so they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin by doing it by making responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can replace people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and government and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow to be valuing their own person, valuing their individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people out there who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
And so let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen, because we're just going to create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you can never be <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are you in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is at two distance. What would it mean for her if I was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that I would assure you, because I didn't have long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a <unk> feet ...
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would take your potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is telling us all.
But let's take our kids to the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is, we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And they would put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year old year will become safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
Last November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense League League <unk>
He was initially surprised by it, but being a prisoner on the other old charges in the company of others, they started planning on the attacks of about 12 <unk> of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. headquarters
Luckily those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant to the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb in the World Trade Center in the World Trade Center could not escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, a <unk> elementary school teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
So I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't need much to get to wish the same things in life.
However, all of the human group -- all of human group -- there are always a small fraction of people who were being transferred to their convictions that think you have to use every possible means that they all lived like them.
A few months before he arrest her arrest and explained to me that in the last weekends he and he explained to me that in the last weekends he and some friends, had been going to <unk> training over Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point the goal at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot shot and gave her little orange light on the goal and, for surprise of all, especially mine, all of the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to each other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot, in the northern tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times, that instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a moment of pack and go to another city.
As I was always the face of the class of the class as often as I was <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the <unk> silent class and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> for growing under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
And I was inspired by the opera and to judge people, based on viral indicators as their race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a <unk> victim -- almost my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids we had done, friendship, I was Jewish.
I took several days out of the light and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe I was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in the Bush <unk> a park of <unk>
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught to me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay men were wrong.
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics I'd ever seen in life.
Having been <unk> of a child, developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would expect to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast to the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that of being homosexual but I know what is to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes, the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep my heart forever while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that somebody else who's to take the violence, it can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and because of their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has made them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism -- I'm talking about those meaningless acts, such as rejection of my father's actions.
And with this simple picture, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible film <unk>
It's in 3D and it has sound that you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, you famine, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as long as your childhood moments project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film -- you, you and you and you.
There's nothing we know about, more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are aware of.
consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that <unk> what we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective by nature.
<unk> for nature, is subjective to change.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the 20th century, we will get that vision.
Now, psychology studied modern behavior, neuroscience was an neuroscience of the objectively not but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Twenty years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the science of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something of this kind of fantastic work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers to some questions that we want to explain to your consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
It doesn't tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> internal movie.
In this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all emerging behaviors -- how do they work <unk> how they are <unk> and they're adapting and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how it works.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we talk, how we play <unk> they're all questions about the behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why it's that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> science.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works for a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk>
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a kind of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were at the beginning <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here with one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem about consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective movie film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and then you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the <unk> bricks -- space and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> them like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more fundamental.
On the contrary, it's considered fundamental to me, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, Brazilian phenomena found that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, copyright laws, and he applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, time, time, mass, load, then for a question of logic -- you have the list of it.
The most natural would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a matter of science as well.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern how to govern consciousness, the laws that connect our awareness to other fundamental concepts -- space, time, time, the mass processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws they are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, every system is conscious, not only the humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when he thinks I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling, <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so crazy?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's a politician, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the awareness of information.
Whenever there is information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex, like a human <unk> complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse is a kind of information integration of information, very significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
In fact, <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind us.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that you put fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I was not supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a vegan.
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hunger.
I think by thinking good, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness on other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> film.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computer systems and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk -- at this moment, we have a TED consciousness, a TED film for this full group of TED -- different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
And I'm actually sure in the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is that the second thing is that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness, that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village at all.
I had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I stood up with my friends, I got married with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to interview it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> series.
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
A few years later, being in the second part of teaching myself at a high school school in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about things that are <unk> on school?"
And then it was general, in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people such as inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to love it. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, you have sold the lie that disability is something -- <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability for you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running through carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call done porn.
And I use the term porn -- you know, because of a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> to the disability for the disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad for my life, it could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been taught me to say that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going on before my work had a public profile.
It was like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images with disability to people with disabled people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I'm going to refer me to the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we're more disability because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
So the things I need to do, and I have learned to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here with the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not for something for anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I'm lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick the things that they fall over.  Let's take the ingenious trick of how to upload the battery of the mobile phone battery in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a minimum stretch of stairs has never been <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen will not make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all of those books to the honor.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> by getting out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade in a high school in a high school is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think to know about what does it.
Thank you.
What do you have to do the augmented reality and the professional reality of <unk>
And what's the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so you don't get <unk>
When people think of reality -- they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the reality of it.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of play at 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man feels like a pound of 110 pounds -- trying to <unk> it with all his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And I took some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment I get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the field of football, from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the kind of virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, no.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When you can be <unk> running through the <unk> and throw out the ball of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour as a <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's only virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So here is a brief scan on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> in Baltimore to put a <unk> to his field of field to live faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> of the field and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player going to your group, and you see your next place in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or for you to memorize the strategy.
You just go out to the field and they react.
And the coaches want them because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your playing game.
How do you do this?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
They have <unk> information.
This is going to take good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that the field <unk>
It <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you know, a defense behind you is going to kill you, and you don't get it, but the <unk> system will get you.
It was going to be the protection area.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open application.
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land, but the receptor sees it in their bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed it from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
You want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of the only use of reality.
We're going to use it as bread and circus, as our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how they're their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they become <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of notes <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> like all of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the country <unk> the southern end of the county County, which includes the bridge Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk> test.
suicide from the bridge is not practical or practical, and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> like that, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body strikes water about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> breaks bones, some of which we would have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The fact that no, you know, normally <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this suicide method becomes the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people were before they take their life.
I can tell you an experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darker time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you very joy that we had successful that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
So let's try to channel the path through these calls.
This wasn't just a bad service for those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers too.
We've come along a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government officers people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 Julius <unk> last year to receive a call from a possible suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a official Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was actually flown up to two times from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of men's <unk>
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just had to take his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how she was.
The parents of Jason had a order.
<unk> damage are affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone was <unk>
What do you say?
Why is that?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like, because they probably won't.
It just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do about <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email about a couple days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing that <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience of being there.
I'm thinking that I should go on to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with her father at the 19 of January.
It never got there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> not having a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and walk the path his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible <unk> subject on the front sidewalk near the north north.
I took my bike, and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to see that day I'll go back on that lane and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do that he did that I <unk> and <unk> the hope and life is <unk>
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I am <unk>
You told me to talk and just give it up.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of September 11, and you're one of the reasons Kevin <unk> with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like she's saying.
We give God for you.
I really hate you with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you would <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active father.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I have found on work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, an absolute opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about people another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and calls suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with only -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And over that time, I would love her hand three times.
I looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we come to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those who have jumped from the bridge, and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave next to the day, they realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be aware of doing.
suicide <unk>
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and you know what you are, and a question asks you, "How do you bother it?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- anyway.
When I became a model, I felt I had achieved the dream that had had since a child.
My outside was finally <unk> with my inner truth, with me.
For a complicated reasons, which I will go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, you know, we managed to get it, <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations by the color of skin or the beliefs that around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo -- what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent -- and ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded as a <unk> at birth because the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in the head.
And my mom was going, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
And I said, "Mom, that's my hair.
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I thought I am a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every single day I appreciate being woman.
I have my mom, dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was 15, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a contest of <unk> beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk>
He said to me that if I was <unk> she was responsible for the mandatory <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won <unk> I won <unk> and I got third finalist in the over 40 candidate
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of the beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to <unk> remote provinces of them.
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you cling to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was putting two <unk> my name.
She also accompanied me when I was approached by Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries of Thailand and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or power to get a <unk> but for me to be the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> she lived his truth, but that, <unk> put in the end of his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All over 20 November, we make a global <unk> by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there was no more <unk> of 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My network of support, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women <unk> who I <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it. I would take my mom and call my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other no. It's just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned to us a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be an understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. <unk> Thank you.
In lots of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is being known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts went to 2011, and the National Prize National Park was very famous -- a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, their birth <unk>
It's not welcome by his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When the second child gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only did the Mother <unk> but the daughter has just <unk> when it grows, they suffer too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she was home and the school admits of her brothers.
Until 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you give him to go out of your home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It turns into the honor of her father and her brothers and her brothers and her family and if you were going to take the code of that of course honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this is that the honor code of honor, doesn't just affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and his happiness of her sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man who has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson for her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> they started from the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I put a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was growing up, when she was four and a half years and the <unk> in my school.
Now you might ask, why should I mention a child for a girl at a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many countries, but in the poor countries, in traditional societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of her identity and her name.
One thing to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went through the form of a visa -- Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter, <unk>
I sat down to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They took brothers and sisters, and for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in the society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the economic and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were gone.
They forbade them to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper to the blog of the BBC, he was offered her to the documentaries of the New York Times, and he spoke in every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine October of October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between my life, and she was death, I was hearing about my wife -- <unk> <unk> so I spent my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the right cause.
<unk> your life for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask them again.
When I <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to make me good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
They took brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the harder moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that even though it's an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when he doesn't just do it.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before joining Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation in the brain.
You're still as smart or not?
If you don't, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the <unk> <unk> of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix them from chemicals, and try to break them into life.
I have been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is actually no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixes and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the <unk> dose of the dramatically <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> for a few months, I tried for a few months, I tried a little dose of <unk> and I was surprised by looking at how I would find my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all of the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past, I've met a number of guys like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, and since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do about the <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think almost always in images, and that became my key point of <unk> how to get these mental pictures that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things differently.
They thought the images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who are asking this idea, and there are lots of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental imagery are fundamental to the <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I managed to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really, really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use their imagination only to lead the world to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as a way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the only thing is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of these used <unk> technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain -- you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his Harvard colleagues can see.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person looking at an image.
The column of the medium shows the scanning brain scan of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. Is it almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they took their brains to create a great sign of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they took a new <unk>
And the computer using just the brain brain information scanning it, to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up to us.
We're well close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of higher resolution, available today, and its resolution to rise as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and put electrodes on it.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques of imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of <unk> first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements with a slightly different <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI are to make <unk> really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> of FM radio, into MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, the structured magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns to <unk> radio frequencies to <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing processing patterns, we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can split into layers our rising knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid -- but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We are able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be wise to use to amplify our design skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the disease cure and similar diseases.
We have few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have through in life.
And this whole thing is a difficult conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
He doesn't like that, and it must happen.
A few years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head made a little bit, I would usually ask you a little boy to say, "Hey, are you a <unk>
And it would appear to be uncomfortable at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I put it down inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
I should have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was ready to enter full of the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues," I would <unk>
And so I took a deep breath, and I went down to my backs and my backs a four-year-old girl with a little bit of pink staring at me -- which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just one girl with a question: "You are <unk>
And so I took a deep one, again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing, though.
I have my hair just like a boy, and I saw coffee clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a ninja <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me, and she was paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and she has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it.
What about the <unk> which is <unk>
It was the easiest <unk> conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl from the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how it feels like it feels living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from you or you're in yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why I come out of my age, it was harder than come out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared on online bank -- it's harder to tell you it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than to tell your five-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only a hard thing.
We need to stop thinking about what is difficult to deal with how difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
And I had a horse tail -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant <unk> <unk> to fight any four year-old boy who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear of my <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my gay, and the move only one muscle is the most scary thing ever ever done.
My family, my whole friends, with the ones I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't release that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was at my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I loved.
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your television television show.
Our program <unk> Will Grace and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> battery.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realizing that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be true with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how difficult conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of anything, is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee I had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be direct <unk> Just <unk>
If you know they're gay, you go.
If they say to their parents that might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be used by that.
And some of them can be hurt safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your yours -- your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet -- you know, a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they can feel very simple yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence, a <unk> quote has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the very question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and the Earth of Earth and intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you would see this to be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, which <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for instance, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that supports the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for several years ago: there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I have ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is an infrared force, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the choices open with a force T, with the diversity of possible future energy, Yes, even an impending future time."
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Now, intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping choices open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the <unk> level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be able to become more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings.
But what if that happens if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find out inside.
<unk> <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, playing human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to figure out how to balance <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for <unk> robotics and human technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate by pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we can successfully see playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the very connected network.
This same capacity in network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we organize the routes of a fleet of boats, and finding them successful and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applied to problems and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> to increase the assets under its management dimensions.
This ability to risk management will have broad applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom to action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term robot, the work <unk> there was always the concept that if we were going to make smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, going on.
The machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion -- the reverse reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the impulse to take control of all of the possible future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence or help them understand human intelligence, it must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is orbiting other stars, which is what the Earth is just between one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the light intensity that measures light intensity of stars when the planets go through them and blocking a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
In <unk> this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets of our solar system, and also the number of light they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale has <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a scientist of the weather, nor <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe can tell you that the more planets look like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, shown this by a mission as the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, that's why we studied both on Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
But private companies now offer not just short space flights but also <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But despite all these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the equatorial areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on Earth the air is cool and full of oxygen. It will spread through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement of Mars from Mars and other planets will drag with a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
So I like to like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell you that the <unk> will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just get closer to home.
So if we can understand how to create and keep spaces of <unk> in the hostile areas of the land, and we can be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment that was <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked myself, realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence for life in life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to view the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the very easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the table of dining table where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but it certainly no more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, even though in the circumstances, of the circumstances, I would be totally stuck.
I'm a neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate increases at the level of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, so that I could put it in his place, which would argue bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, which is going to be a total chance of a total catastrophe to happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts are not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared who had been practicing with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this for a few years ago, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> like explaining <unk> you go ahead and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things that were going to stop or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious one.
In the house, you take a place for things that are very easily.
It sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to be tracking the location of the important things, where it's right, where the fish are -- that <unk> the <unk> trees where the tribes are working and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and still you could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason to lose your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home you would take a place for the keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular <unk>
For your reading glasses, a particular <unk>
If you pick up a place and you're <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take your cell phone, a picture of your credit license cards -- license muscle license, passport, for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all making of medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decisions that we need to take a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart <unk>
So you are thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you to reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even as you know people who <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to speak and the drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery at any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't ask me, something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not about the doctor, and if it's someone, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just from 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I did the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress doesn't think about clarity.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the talk of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out of <unk> by the drug that you can help the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is what's required, is part of the first consent of consent consent of consent of it.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number one needs to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the older men of the 1950s, <unk> prostate cancer, the number we need to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue to you about the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least one is trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a whole bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, they don't react quickly. They could be the lunch of the lions, so nothing that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational <unk> like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to take them to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I settled on a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the front door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, -- the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over in the early 1800s, and over the time of the time, it was mixed with local signals, and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world is like I lived in a foreign world -- following blindly by their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk> behaviors.
So how do I understand the sound ...
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people are.
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise from eating a bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they didn't get covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of sound label than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Am I going to become more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided I decided to reclaim sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the number of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency of it.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could get it out.
I chose it to <unk>
There's a massive culture around language language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I am able to keep a temporary time for something like taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to stay with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can you not capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into lots of different <unk>
If you get a <unk> different <unk> for each finger while the piano is playing the <unk> the speed, the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you put out just a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers, you need to express a clear concept.
If only one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning of it.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal goes into that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I look at <unk> through your music?
If I had to create a sign of it, and it would take it again and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and you put it.
This is all day."
If you break it up, and you look at the speed, the visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said -- <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how far the distance is to express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and a dramatic idea at once.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a story is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please get back again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in my head and my chest but they transmit very different meanings themselves.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and nation, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have a sound that has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> developing its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learning <unk> I don't have to hear about learning music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure. and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to remind you to open your ears, to open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "You can take it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, and where everything was possible.
So I grew up on a bubble of innocence, or a bubble of ignorance or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good for cleaning those other people.
Time time, I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in the Hong Kong school.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk on the beach on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we clean the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too expensive to use those enormous boat.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> job so that the children very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
So let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do that.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every single child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just information about <unk>
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> kids get a lot of the robots.
Then we create very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we basically transform lamps and <unk> and <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits floating through the sensor while the computer on board while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an estimate of plastic in the water.
I took this step back to a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you see the Internet -- you get <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using hands on <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that you drink is the water in which the water <unk> where the water is going to live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil also are brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra and what can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other way to other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe addressing a harder problem, and also close to me.
I'm half Japanese and half a French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> and the various cities across the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the majority of the time, it is certainly blue. It's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and research and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I <unk> the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks
It might seem like they didn't take serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that the radioactive powder would be bent from the summit of the mountain to the system <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear center to date.
We can zoom in to a mile of the nuclear, and with the fishermen aid of the area we were collecting sediments on the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit like so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the Hong Kong of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, which can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or, we can help with the mobility of the age of age transforming their standard wheels into new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists scientists, <unk> <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two million, <unk> two different design cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other of a single silk thread alone.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thought I thought it is.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the raw, <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living things aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we have all the information required it for each cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects in order to think of their objects as <unk> from different parts with different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You operate primarily as filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation by variation.
Here is a split screen, which represents my view of the world -- twice the personality of every single designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the <unk> between Henry Ford Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthetic -- shows you two screens after me.
My work, in its most simple level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and moving up.
You're probably asking you why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where we had four disciplines that offers access to the tools we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through the scale of the large-scale scale, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter with a base of which one day not very far to print buildings and graphics buildings made of <unk> genetically aesthetic <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Greek architecture, and he has created a screen where every opening is the only size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion show of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> machine.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the instruments that are allowed to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair that we have to be comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, shape its functionality not by the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> material.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't raised myself in a religious home but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me, and he was going to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees growing up with twigs, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects were made of one part?
It was a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that the kind of material was going to do -- the type of material in the tree filled with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year for organisms as mild shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We wanted a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from <unk> hard from <unk> <unk> and <unk>
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material and create these structures that are made of one single material that was 3.5 feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are high, it lets them dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why are we still designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first showed first of us on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the Blank <unk> we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> it just rather than <unk> metal metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these agricultural crops.
In our first piece of clothing, in our first piece of clothes, two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract tract -- that will help that flow these bacteria and to build their function on the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it <unk> more transparent channels.
This digestive system <unk> when it stretch away from one end to another, 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times as much as our very short intestine in a little bit.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are last <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissues that are harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer actually <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly conservative architecture a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which those fibers are among each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The worm worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension, <unk> and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we glue a little magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the men's worm.
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat <unk> not inside a box, we realized that you would <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environment, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the composition, the <unk> the structure of <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
You often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw what we saw is designing these <unk> we could shape the raw silk <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms were going to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- it will destroy the silk worms about the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We were asking for silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and she was right.
By <unk> biological silk about the silk -- <unk> <unk> give this whole canopy to integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms are <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> silk arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology of materials, designers must unite these two visions of the world.
Which takes us around the back, of course, at the beginning.
This is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired by nature by nature inspired by us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be from <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the websites and I discovered websites -- I also would play the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I got rid of something else, something completely different, and I got myself excited about it, and I let myself be <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot to anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all of my passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad at me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or whether to be battling or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you to have asked you to get asked now.
<unk> itself, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they learned it from culture.
We asked first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk>
It's considered a naive question to make beautiful answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is about again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students who are going to pick up at university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you take off the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream of what might be, not inspire to dream of everything they might be.
In fact, just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, although well-intentioned <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what nice, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher in <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're a person who is not connected in this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
<unk> is someone with lots of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
Could it help if you divide up in three parts: some potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms to be able to use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You know, any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or whatever you should have to beat.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared on cartography, of data, visualization, mathematics and design, to found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired by inspired recently.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all of their backgrounds, you can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second <unk> <unk> is very fast.
When <unk> <unk> we are <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of proving new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned to every new zone that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time and an independent time.
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible capacity to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before to become a writer, he was a horrible financial farmer.
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices started to be able to write compelling launches for editors.
<unk> a loss of time is a loss of time to get to you even if at the end of the end, you know.
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. So the ability to transform into anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other designer designer, sometimes a website, sometimes a teacher, sometimes a teacher, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take various <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put together ideas, and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that adapt to the way we're connected.
And, unfortunately, the <unk> in large part will be told to be more like their <unk> <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner wiring is whatever.
If you're a heart attack, then you spread through all media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for <unk> in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with her many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> led her to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, he wrote a <unk> and found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of one guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprisingly,
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give her to her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been moved into the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I am part of a team of scientists working to find a cure cure for Alzheimer's more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
<unk> now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of contract to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability of spending their years Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be dear disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs from five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs more Alzheimer's and cause a similar annual number of deaths from deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everybody is Alzheimer's -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, even scientists, consistent Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, compared to the family of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and abilities -- the damage to the brain caused by significantly energy, reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
And for almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There's places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups who can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University at Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
They can get others to make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that blocked it and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new type of drugs that are typically typically testing this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when I test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms -- on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stick to each other, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince them that Alzheimer's is a disease, and that if we can quantify it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment at the end of the 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
<unk> is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain run the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They would talk for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the Romantic <unk> New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, I do this.
The article about a psychological study is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try to test it myself.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to make 36 more and more personal questions and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was it the last time you went to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a little detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to prove this study, with someone who knew not particularly too well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I think it was a good story, so I thought it was a good story, so I send them to the absolute column -- but a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's a <unk> so I guess some of you probably probably ask some of you -- they are together <unk>
And the reason I think it's <unk> this is because I've been asked this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on an romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come up to a few hundred of us as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably some thousands of view.
And that has a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But they had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and then Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called me Camp Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, I was just prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing together about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were the students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I have TV interviews, and I put the requests requests from us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study did work, they wanted to know if they really <unk> or actually if it was able to produce love love, not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and then they <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of making these <unk> less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants had felt closer after doing that, several more studies, also used <unk> protocol as a fast way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community. And they have used it between people of <unk> political ideologies in the community.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a very small liberal arts college, and then a student came to me and told me about <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> by it.
And I said, "You want to say you're going to get you out of the person who owns it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> who did have been able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that any of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult quality.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took it into science.
And I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that I could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used as I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I come after.
But I can also see it more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much as you can demand me.
What I'm looking for is a <unk> not just being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate something from the risk of <unk> and this is a very unequal story, because in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes/No.
So more than a question, <unk> asking questions of questions like, How do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't it?
How will they stay in love when things got off, and how do you know when to cut and get it.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we were still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper, the love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading it now, not because it wasn't true, but because in the moment, I hadn't considered everything that choice was.
I didn't think how many times we would have that decision, and how much times I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody so generous, and fun and expressed that choice in the largest American newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think about.
And what I want, and what maybe happened to be my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way I came as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York has a time ago --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with it when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and I took a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would take -- ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from field and <unk> and <unk> and all those things -- and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> at the stage, Martin, the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she is <unk> and so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could be <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of the opposite that it seemed to rise again as if it was to be <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow together -- draw the same thing around a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and I created my own taxonomy of suicide <unk>
First of all, I want you to make an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exposures and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, <unk> of natural size drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I love it.
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing in a window, and then another window and another window, and I had all these windows together forming a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
<unk>
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of its time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double expensive, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals with animals are heading to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform, the <unk> refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But in fact, some kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> which keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> feet long as it joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail has to turn to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
And so it takes me to my last project.
I'm in the midst of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one of them acts as a kind of file in the form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they're together, they divide it.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it can be <unk> the entrance is <unk>
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or whatever it is that you have, a kind of thing that you get.
It's a quick fan of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and is communicating between two.
There are some pills that go out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a school, a publishing book that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people within each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you ask yourself, who is and the box in which it is living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill that's the most effective and <unk> system for any drug, effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on its most negative, because in time that it takes you to get to the current current. You get off and worse than time it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV shop.
These are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood flow of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, viruses can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for a life of life that is oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "We will get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for maternal wounds and diabetes surgery, you can be used for anything else -- including the drug drug transportation.
And in fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill holes extremely small, which open up and close holes -- almost immediately.
The best people are asked, "How do you <unk>
We sent a small and powerful beam of laser on the cell membrane infected with HIV whereas these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
Now we're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug -- it frees it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to maintain open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of any research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand these generators.
I do some field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors and actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of <unk> peace in 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been signed between a state and a non-state actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know a lot of the reasons why we can do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they didn't survive.
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, it has also established a political party, a social network network and a military system.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They are multitasking things.
It was a complex machinery of <unk> radio stations, television, TV websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising problem, but by <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, will increase their funds, to better recruit and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run <unk> they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not safe and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high death price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means to fill a void -- a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of <unk> Palestinian cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid guys.
<unk> because they fill themselves gaps by the government, and emerge like armed and political groups, participating in violent fighting and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations, are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How would I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, and run all of its function, collect the trash, and run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, and <unk> nations, and the weaker and the more weak it is states, as in the Middle East, the more step further and fill that gap in the <unk>
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in raw tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand the groups that are better at groups -- we will understand what to provide to foster the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors don't know the military power can win some battles, but not to give peace and stability.
To get these targets we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but fear that are going to accept the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a neuroscientist, but pretty bad.
And so I would tell you, as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a piece of paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, he had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and hated sex. Like that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who begs too much, with high self-esteem and dares to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
At the time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also a proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I would have the same job for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as they were <unk> or <unk> or violence.
We have right to use very easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and social condition, and so much more.
We need to be aware of these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music at all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and it offends me, deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang is amazing.
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical question.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the nice thing.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to embrace the name of her husband, it is his choice, and I'm not the one who is <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise their children, I agree that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's take this problem.
<unk> our conventional feminism that has ignored or diverted historically the needs of women of color, gay and gay workers and <unk> in favor of white women, <unk> middle class.
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist thing.
It also happens the next thing as a feminist, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we get rid of we take them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to get myself out of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative people, and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They're afraid of standing and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what it means is that <unk> is not being able to fulfill the <unk>
Take for example, <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star from pop star and will look openly and to make women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time -- the cultural critics began a lot of endless debates if we were <unk> it was not quite a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much so <unk>
We go so much beyond sensible criticism and constructive <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give birth to action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions get rid of this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and also very <unk> I want to grow in a world.
They're going to be confused by the strong creatures they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will become much more easy to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program tries to sex violence against women as a sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio tape when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies do not treat women more than like symmetrical objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, heterosexuals can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't have enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or the organization is more <unk> with a wider range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be participating in this kind of projects, we can also encourage them to be included until more as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to decision making.
Because we are not a <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without having these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and film producers and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, more courageous, to create durable and significant.
We can also claim with bravery our question, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist unless it's <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of the reasons, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't tell me to believe something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you get the brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little courageous one, another woman could <unk> and see and realize that none of us is the world about telling us we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the ultimate reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad coma. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need more of such courage.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak <unk> they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, was not the article that sparked controversial about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by the British Medical Telescope.
It doesn't believe most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism increasing in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare.
And the few psychologists and <unk> who had heard of him create to develop their own professional life without seeing one case.
During decades, the prevalence estimates kept stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> for hedge fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people in the Center for Disease Disease Disease What's going on, what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "A better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language does not <unk> the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son of two years of eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be understood why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the process of storytelling.
Over the most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we come here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> -- he published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed <unk> a private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were <unk> panic like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients in his clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s as a major authority of the world in the subject, he stated that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they were <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria in <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he became <unk> that he had turned to nine of 10 children sent to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child pumps caused by cold parents and <unk>
These children, he said, they were carefully kept in a refrigerator that wouldn't be <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite son, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were just asking them what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two children of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband was warm and <unk> and they had a very deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed licenses without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more beautifully and diverse and diverse and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> like <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model, would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been ashamed of these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the <unk> article -- and then he <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
Not even an English translation of course, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he spoke German, and he was the translated for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running an integrated clinic with a college school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids were still their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of collaboration and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> culture like the awkward social scientist and the Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria for the diagnostic criteria that they called the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> and replacing the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk>
These changes didn't fell on broken down.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between projects to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> of experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four prizes of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials are introduced to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> and they were actually hoping that what the people with autism and their families finally would have the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful story -- and <unk> credible history as bad as <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are at the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have <unk> people on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving new ideas, medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that one PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it is cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> and <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit at detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
Seventy years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most behavioral aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford to afford no brain.
Thank you.
